Basic GIT configurationEdit
Repository
$ git clone "https://repos.britenet.com.pl/sonae.git"
Edit
Configuration
$ git config --global user.name "First Name Last Name" 
$ git config --global user.email firstname.lastname@britenet.com.pl
$ git config --global credential.helper store
$ git config --global http.sslVerify false
$ git config --global pull.ff only
$ git config --global merge.ff only
$ git config --global push.default simple
Pull.ff only and merge ff.only options will only allow for fast-forward merges, that does not produce conflicts. 
Push.default simple will set the default push behavior to only pushing current branch and not all changed branches.

Edit
Development branches
Dev branch:

git checkout dev
Use case branch:

git checkout -b uc_01
git commit …
git push
git checkout dev
git merge uc_01
Dev branch (also known as “unstable” branch) and optional use case branches are the only branches new code can be committed to. All changes from use case branches have to be merged into dev branch before they can be tested.

git checkout testing

Cherry pick instruction:

git checkout testing
git pull
git cherry-pick COMMIT_HASH
git push
To test simply switch to testing branch, pull changes from remote, merge changes from dev branch and push them to the server. Alternatively, you can cherry pick specific commits from dev branch (not recommended).

If bugs are found during this phase, developer should push fixes to the dev branch, which then can be merged into testing using the same procedure as above.

Edit
Master (stable) branch
Master (stable) branch is the final branch in the development cycle. Changed from the testing branch should be merged into it and then tested for regressions.

git checkout master
git pull
git merge testing
git push
